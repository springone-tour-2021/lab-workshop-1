[Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) is another tool we can use in our Kubernetes toolbox that allows us to customize deployments to different environments
We can start with a base set of resources and then apply customizations on top of those

Features
* Allows easier deployments to different environments/providers
* Allows you to keep all the common properties in one place
* Generate configuration for specific environments
* No templates, no placeholder spaghetti, no environment variable overload
